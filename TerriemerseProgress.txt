::Rotate and scale tools:
::161018::
-Rotate- -CHECK
	I'll need to get the starting rotation and add to it - there's a function within the move script that should cover that

-Scale- -CHECK
	Can I throw all of the measurement tool objects into the same group?


-Interact with objects- -- CHECK
	-Use VRTK?- -- No - Too complex and not needed
	-I need to check if the object is interacting 
	-This script is going to handle object interaction and events 

	-Each of the objects could have a script that handles the object interaction
	-A public gameobject to assign the script component 
		-Which then assigns the script to the controller that selected it  


-Measurement and Delete Tool- -- CHECK
	-Make objects for each of these -- add to the switch statement 
	-Make delete tool for Measurement tool

	-Had to knock the scale of measurement tool down from::  12 -> .2  and line renderer: 1 -> .1 -- REMEMBER THIS!!!

-Finalize interaction script- -- CHECK
	-add the delete and measurement tools to the switch statement


-Assign all Objects to HoverBelt- 
	-It may be possible to set everything else up outside the main scene and bring it in that way
		-Do it that way!
	-Right now it's not reading intersections from the objects
		-Perhaps it's reading intersections, but it's not activating the script - CHECK
	-not registerting when the controller is intersecting with a button / exiting - CHECK

-Get this all set up in the Terrimerse Scene- - CHECK
