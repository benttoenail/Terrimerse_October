::Rotate and scale tools:
::161018::
-Rotate- -CHECK
	I'll need to get the starting rotation and add to it - there's a function within the move script that should cover that

-Scale- -CHECK
	Can I throw all of the measurement tool objects into the same group?


-Interact with objects- -- CHECK
	-Use VRTK?- -- No - Too complex and not needed
	-I need to check if the object is interacting 
	-This script is going to handle object interaction and events 

	-Each of the objects could have a script that handles the object interaction
	-A public gameobject to assign the script component 
		-Which then assigns the script to the controller that selected it  


-Measurement and Delete Tool- -- CHECK
	-Make objects for each of these -- add to the switch statement 
	-Make delete tool for Measurement tool

	-Had to knock the scale of measurement tool down from::  12 -> .2  and line renderer: 1 -> .1 -- REMEMBER THIS!!!

-Finalize interaction script- -- CHECK
	-add the delete and measurement tools to the switch statement


-Assign all Objects to HoverBelt- 
	-It may be possible to set everything else up outside the main scene and bring it in that way
		-Do it that way!
	-Right now it's not reading intersections from the objects
		-Perhaps it's reading intersections, but it's not activating the script - CHECK
	-not registerting when the controller is intersecting with a button / exiting - CHECK

-Get this all set up in the Terrimerse Scene- - CHECK


::161019::
	-Scaling CameraRig - Does not work!
	
-Add Colliders to Measurement objects- -- CHECK 
-Make sure the measurement tools are working -- 
	-Figure out why the Measurement tool is not working!! -- CHECK
-Make Objects scale when hovered- 
	-Create script to attach to objects to scale when intersected -- CHECK
	-Make a new Delete tool - Export as FBX -- CHECK
	-Scale back to oringal size when exit -- --CHECK - sort of...
		--at this moment it's not animating, only snapping 

-Scale scene properly- 
	-At this moment, the scene is not scaling as it should... 
	-I can't scale the data set, because if I do all of the markers that have been applied will scale as well, thus ruining the measurements
	-I need to scale the camera rig up and down - that's the best and easiest solution
		-Except I'm getting awful errors -- For some reason the errors stopped happening?? -- Need to divide the scaling down by 500 
		-The belt is not scaling accordingly
-Parent objects to the belt -- CHECK 
	

::161020::
-Paradox-
	-Right now there are two very pressing matters- The issue with the scaling and the ability to turn off and on the point clouds
		-To submit a more finished product, I should work on turnining off and on the point clouds - the issue with the scaling can wait 

-Create CloudButton- --CHECK
-Pass GameObject and Name info into the cloudBlock- -- CHECK
-On controller click and interaction, turn off associated gameobject- --CHECK
	-Seems like the script is looking for the hoverbelt
-Scale button when entering- -- CHECK
-Make sure this setup works with actual dataset- 
	-Use a smaller dataset while testing -- CHECK

-Translate CloudList- 
	-Create another gameobject that'll house the PClist - parent list into that object -- CHECK
	-Translate Cloudlist with the "arrow" objects -- CHECK

-Controller Trigger Events-
	At this moment, the controller trigger events are a complete disastor.  The hoverbelt falls apart immediately, for some reason i cannot click while intersecting with
another object (unless I press the trigger on the other controller?), and the PCList is bouncing around erradically while I translate it.  
	Objects are not scaling along with the camera rig - for instance the PCList is not going to translate.  As this present moment, what I have is almost unworkable.

	Tomorrow, try to implement Wiley's version of the hoverbelt.  If you can get that up and running, I'm sure it'll be more stable than what you currently
have.  Make the PCList translatable, and open and closable.  Shoot for these items tomorrow night:
	-Implement wiley's HoveBelt while using the tools you've created-
	-Make PCList translatable, open and closable-
	

::161021::
-Get Wiley's hoverbelt version up and running with your tools-
	-Get wiley's hoverbelt up and running in terrimmerse- -- CHECK
	-Getting the tools up and running-
		-How do I attach scripts when certain items are clicked?
		-Check out wiley's project, get some answers -- CHECK

-Wiley gave me some sagelike advice, and I now know how to proceed. 
	-I'll need to add a watcher gameobject to the controller which updates when a gameobject is instatiated and parented to the controller
	

::161022::
-Recreating more stable tools-
	-Create prefabs with tools attached- -- CHECK -- Still need measure tools - Make sure setup works first
	-Modify code to work with this specific setup-
		-Rotate- -- CHECK
		-Scale- -- CHECK

-Attach a watcher script to the playerObject that keeps track of attached tools- 
	-I need the tracker script to delete the current tool, and update it with the incoming tool
	-Attach Gameobject via the tracker script- --CHECK
	-Replace the Tool with incoming tool- -- CHECK
		-Measure- -- CHECK
		-Delete- -- Delete tool not finding the measurement object
	-Make measurement object a VRMenu Button -- CHECK
-Add all current buttons to hoverbelt- --CHECK

-Get belt working with the DataSet- --CHECK
-Parent measurements to DataSet- -- CHECK
-Set up scale to scale player rig- -- CHECK
-Slow Down rotation- CHECK

-Creating a scroll list-
	-Check out wiley's project and see if you can find out how to set that up-
	-Change Text Component- -- CHECK
	-Connect button Presses to VRMenu Events- --CHECK
	-Get buttons working with VRMenu- -- CHECK
	-Replace all prefabs with buttons- -- CHECK
	-Set to scroll- -- CHECK
	-Change color of text- -- CHECK - Made another solution
	-Give a move handle- how do i check if trigger is up?
	-Open and close-
		-When opening, point towards user 

-Current issues-
	-Set "DrawTool()" to off when controller is deleting- --The Bool is currently not updating in the script!!!
	-Turn off Measurement tool when Intersecting another object- -- use If/Else
	-Belt needs to scale along with the scale of the player- 
		--I'd need to modify the belt items script	




::161013::
-Mesh Conversion-
	-Bring the converted Meshes into the main project- CHECK
	-Create a single gameObject for both dataSets- -- CHECK
	-Put the right numbered sets into each group- -- CHECK
	-Connect the meshes to the on/off switches in the PCList-
		-I have to pull in both Mesh and cloud lists into the CloudButtonHandler -- CHECK
		-Pull in both Mesh and Point cloud object into each button instance- -- CHECK
		-Turn both on/off with button clicks- -- CHECK
		-Toggle Points and mesh viz- --CHECK

-PCList opening and Closing-
	-When opening PCList, have it open next to player- --CHECK (a poor man's solution for now...)

>>Ongoing Issues<<
-Draw tool needs to draw at interactor point -- CHECK
-Top mesh is being drawn twice- -- CHECK
-if interacting with a button, don't do anything- -- CHECK
	-Create a base class and inherit throughout all tools??-
-Right controller, once given a tool, doesn't close hoverBelt (sometimes??)-
-Close button on PCList closes the list- CHECK
	-Works, but cause problems after using it
-Scaling issues with belt and menus- -- CHECK
	-Scaling with multiplication (A math problem)- CHECK
	-Scaling the PClist needs to stop- --CHECK
-List needs to deactivate on opening- CHECK
-Need to convert the rest of the point clouds (That I can)- --CHECK
-When instatiating the PCList, buttons are huge!!-  CHECK
-PCList Not connected to objects- --CHECK
-MC and PC buttons need to find clouds- CHECK
-Turn off belt when select tool- -CHECK
-Swipe through- --CHECK
-Slow down rotation-
-BandiCam Footage-
Bring build to other computer-

::Weird things to watch out for::
	-Don't leave one of the point cloud or mesh cloud groups off when you turn off the list tool.  When you try to reactivate the tool, it won't be able to find the cloud group
you previously deactivated, and once you try to reactivate after having closed the cloud list, the program will shut down. 
	-When using the measuring tool, remember it's origin of creation.  You can delete the measurement tool by clicking the origin sphere, and if you draw another measurement 
and END the measurement in another measurement's origin, the sphere won't release from the controller.  If that happens, use the other controller to delete that current measurment's 
origin sphere. 

:Bam:

::161029::
-The measurement tool is a major issue at the moment - I cannnot delete a measurement from both spheres, and if I'm drawing a sphere and release it into another sphere, or origin sphere,
the sphere won't release and become attached to the controller.
	-Figure out how youre deleting the sphere- CHECK
	-Add VRMenuButton and MeasureDeleteButton after parenting sphere_02 to measurement tool - CHECK
	-Be Able to draw a sphere while in another sphere- -- IN PROGRESS

-Game shuts down when spawning list when one of the lists is turned off-
	-How are the buttons that work handling it?
		-I may have to somehow cache the data whenever I open and close - but there's gotta be an easier solution than that...
	-Is there a way to find objects that are deactivated?
	-Add Scripts to PC / Mesh lists akin to CloudBlock Script-
	-Find DataSet Object when instatiating PC and Mesh clouds- -- CHECK


::Current Issues -- 161029::
-CloudButtons scale async with your own scale when instiating them-
-Draw tool sometimes gets parented to controller 
-PCList opening needs to be optomized more - Need to take player's rotation into account ie instiate in front of player

::Things that'd be nice::
-Belt opens a little too slow
-Graphics for each tool
-An icon that instatiates onto controller signifiying which tool is active 
-Global measurments??
