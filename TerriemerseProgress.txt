::Rotate and scale tools:
::161018::
-Rotate- -CHECK
	I'll need to get the starting rotation and add to it - there's a function within the move script that should cover that

-Scale- -CHECK
	Can I throw all of the measurement tool objects into the same group?


-Interact with objects- -- CHECK
	-Use VRTK?- -- No - Too complex and not needed
	-I need to check if the object is interacting 
	-This script is going to handle object interaction and events 

	-Each of the objects could have a script that handles the object interaction
	-A public gameobject to assign the script component 
		-Which then assigns the script to the controller that selected it  


-Measurement and Delete Tool- -- CHECK
	-Make objects for each of these -- add to the switch statement 
	-Make delete tool for Measurement tool

	-Had to knock the scale of measurement tool down from::  12 -> .2  and line renderer: 1 -> .1 -- REMEMBER THIS!!!

-Finalize interaction script- -- CHECK
	-add the delete and measurement tools to the switch statement


-Assign all Objects to HoverBelt- 
	-It may be possible to set everything else up outside the main scene and bring it in that way
		-Do it that way!
	-Right now it's not reading intersections from the objects
		-Perhaps it's reading intersections, but it's not activating the script - CHECK
	-not registerting when the controller is intersecting with a button / exiting - CHECK

-Get this all set up in the Terrimerse Scene- - CHECK


::161019::
	-Scaling CameraRig - Does not work!
	
-Add Colliders to Measurement objects- -- CHECK 
-Make sure the measurement tools are working -- 
	-Figure out why the Measurement tool is not working!! -- CHECK
-Make Objects scale when hovered- 
	-Create script to attach to objects to scale when intersected -- CHECK
	-Make a new Delete tool - Export as FBX -- CHECK
	-Scale back to oringal size when exit -- --CHECK - sort of...
		--at this moment it's not animating, only snapping 

-Scale scene properly- 
	-At this moment, the scene is not scaling as it should... 
	-I can't scale the data set, because if I do all of the markers that have been applied will scale as well, thus ruining the measurements
	-I need to scale the camera rig up and down - that's the best and easiest solution
		-Except I'm getting awful errors -- For some reason the errors stopped happening?? -- Need to divide the scaling down by 500 
		-The belt is not scaling accordingly
-Parent objects to the belt -- CHECK 
	

::161020::
-Paradox-
	-Right now there are two very pressing matters- The issue with the scaling and the ability to turn off and on the point clouds
		-To submit a more finished product, I should work on turnining off and on the point clouds - the issue with the scaling can wait 

-Create CloudButton- --CHECK
-Pass GameObject and Name info into the cloudBlock- -- CHECK
-On controller click and interaction, turn off associated gameobject- --CHECK
	-Seems like the script is looking for the hoverbelt
-Scale button when entering- -- CHECK
-Make sure this setup works with actual dataset- 
	-Use a smaller dataset while testing -- CHECK

-Translate CloudList- 
	-Create another gameobject that'll house the PClist - parent list into that object -- CHECK
	-Translate Cloudlist with the "arrow" objects -- CHECK

-Controller Trigger Events-
	At this moment, the controller trigger events are a complete disastor.  The hoverbelt falls apart immediately, for some reason i cannot click while intersecting with
another object (unless I press the trigger on the other controller?), and the PCList is bouncing around erradically while I translate it.  
	Objects are not scaling along with the camera rig - for instance the PCList is not going to translate.  As this present moment, what I have is almost unworkable.

	Tomorrow, try to implement Wiley's version of the hoverbelt.  If you can get that up and running, I'm sure it'll be more stable than what you currently
have.  Make the PCList translatable, and open and closable.  Shoot for these items tomorrow night:
	-Implement wiley's HoveBelt while using the tools you've created-
	-Make PCList translatable, open and closable-
	

::161021::
-Get Wiley's hoverbelt version up and running with your tools-
	-Get wiley's hoverbelt up and running in terrimmerse- -- CHECK
	-Getting the tools up and running-
		-How do I attach scripts when certain items are clicked?
		-Check out wiley's project, get some answers -- CHECK

-Wiley gave me some sagelike advice, and I now know how to proceed. 
	-I'll need to add a watcher gameobject to the controller which updates when a gameobject is instatiated and parented to the controller
	

::161022::
-Recreating more stable tools-
	-Create prefabs with tools attached- -- CHECK -- Still need measure tools - Make sure setup works first
	-Modify code to work with this specific setup-
		-Rotate- -- CHECK
		-Scale- -- CHECK

-Attach a watcher script to the playerObject that keeps track of attached tools- 
	-I need the tracker script to delete the current tool, and update it with the incoming tool
	-Attach Gameobject via the tracker script- --CHECK
	-Replace the Tool with incoming tool- -- CHECK
		-Measure- -- CHECK
		-Delete- -- Delete tool not finding the measurement object
	-Make measurement object a VRMenu Button -- CHECK
-Add all current buttons to hoverbelt- --CHECK

-Get belt working with the DataSet- --CHECK
-Parent measurements to DataSet- -- CHECK
-Set up scale to scale player rig- -- CHECK
-Slow Down rotation- CHECK

-Creating a scroll list-
	-Check out wiley's project and see if you can find out how to set that up-

-Current issues-
	-Set "DrawTool()" to off when controller is deleting- --The Bool is currently not updating in the script!!!
	-Turn off Measurement tool when Intersecting another object-
	-Belt needs to scale along with the scale of the player-
